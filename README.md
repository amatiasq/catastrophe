# Catastrophe
> Base building game

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/amatiasq/catastrophe.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/amatiasq/catastrophe)

A brief description of your project, what it is used for.

## Getting started

Run this you idiot:

```shell
npm install
```

You install the shit.

## Developing

### Built With

React and fucking handmade shit.

### Prerequisites

You need shit to make this work

### Setting up Dev

You don't have to do shit.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:amatiasq/catastrophe
cd catastrophe/
npm install
```

You shit.

### Building

Just build the shit.

```shell
npm run build
```

The code will build like shit.

### Deploying / Publishing

Just push to master you shit.

```shell
git push origin master
```

But don't be shitty. Open a PR.

## Versioning

We can maybe use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for shit. For the versions available, see the [link to shit tags on this repository](/tags).

## Configuration

You configure shit on `src/constants.ts`, you shit.

## Tests

No shit.

```shell
npm test
```

Will do no shit.

## Style guide

Write nice code you shit:

- Cast with `value as T` only to cast from interface to class.
- Cast with `value as any` if you have to do shit.
- Move important constant values to `constants.ts`
- Use `notNull(value)` to cast nullable shit to just shit.
- Use `@bind` to bind you idiot.
- Initialize all props in class declaration or in constructor [because of shits](https://gist.github.com/twokul/9501770).
- If constructor receives class props use [automatic assignement of constructor parameters](https://www.stevefenton.co.uk/2013/04/stop-manually-assigning-typescript-constructor-parameters/)
- Omit `public` keyword except in shitty constructor parameters.
- Use `readonly` for readonly shit, you piece of shit.
- Accessors simplify shitty code:
  ```javascript
    this.game.moveEntity(entity, tile);
    // vs
    entity.tile = tile;
  ```

## Api Reference

No shitty API.

## Database

WTF yu taking bout.

## Licensing

UNLICENCED you shit.
