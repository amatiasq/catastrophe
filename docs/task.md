# Tasks

All orders given to workers are expressed as TASKS

## Phases

A Task workflow is divided in 3 phases:

- Definition
- Progress
- Application

###Â Definition

In the definition process the task objective is declared and the task will require or create any structure or values needed for it's execution.

### Progress

This part is repeated in each game tick, sorting tasks by priority so the task with the highest priority will be executed first and the last one might not be executed if there are no workers left.

If the task's `task.isCompleted` property is true it will be disposed.

Progress is also divided in two steps.

#### Assignation

Each tick the game will query the `task.needsWorker()` method to know if more workers need to be assigned to the task. If so it will use `task.isValidWorker(worker)` which should return a numeric value. The highest the value the more appropiate is that worker to execute the task. `0` or lower means the worker is not suitable for the task.

Once a valid worker has received the task it will ask the task for the best place for they to start working using `task.getTargetForWorker(worker)`. After that the worker will start walking to the returned tile.

#### Execution

When a worker has a task assigned it will execute `task.step(worker)` so the task can represent that worker focused that tick on completing the task.

**IMPORTANT**: Any change in models should not be applied on this step, it should instead be delegated into the next phase. To know more about this read the [Application](#Application) phase.

### Application

Once every worker has executed it's task the game loop will ask all tasks to apply any model changes by calling `task.apply()` so the world can update.

A model change is any
- tile state change
- entity state change
    - including entity position change
- any object placed on the map

UI changes are not considered model changes.

This is made in a separated phase so all the work can be made in a stable state and the map recalculations can be executed at most a single time per frame.
