# Game concept

The game is a place where the player can face a catastrophe and not just survive but end up empowered.

## Theme

The game should be dark given the realistic drama situation but it should be goofy and/or minimalistic to reduce assets cost.

## Goal

The goal is for the player to test their hability to plan and organize and empower them through that.

## User experience

The game will separate in two different interactions: giving orders & management.

For the giving orders part the user will just select buttons from the GUI and select areas on the map to execute them.

The management part can be described as a set of tables with important information for the user to make smart decisions and automate behaviour.

## Inspiration

A game about re-building a society that has lost all it's technology advances.

# **Possible** implementation

> Quick and dirty

- A simple grid where the minions move around and place walls and furniture.
- A task handling system that will match pending tasks with idle minions.
